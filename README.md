#  Spring Boot Playground
Welcome to my little **Spring Boot playground** 🚀  
This is where I experiment, break things (sometimes 😅), and learn how Spring Boot really works.

---
##  What’s inside?
- Playing around with **REST APIs**
- Testing **Spring Data JPA** & databases
- Messing with **Spring Security** 🔐
- Trying out **microservices** basics
- Random experiments that may or may not work 😂

---
## 🛠Why this repo?
Because learning is more fun when you get your hands dirty with code!  
This repo is not about “perfect” projects — it’s more like my coding lab 🧪.
