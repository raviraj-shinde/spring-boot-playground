#  Spring Boot Playground
Welcome to my little **Spring Boot playground** 🚀  
This is where I experiment, break things (sometimes 😅), and learn how Spring Boot really works.

---
## 🛠Why this repo?
Because learning is more fun when you get your hands dirty with code!  
This repo is not about “perfect” projects — it’s more like my coding lab 🧪.
