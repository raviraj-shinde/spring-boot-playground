FROM openjdk:17 → starts from an image that already has Java installed.

Build-time variable (only available while building, not in the final container).

WORKDIR - Sets the working directory for subsequent commands (RUN, COPY, CMD, etc).	           
		    - If the directory doesn’t exist, Docker creates it.
                    - Internally: Docker sets this as the "current directory" in container’s filesystem.


ENTRYPOINT ["", "" , ....]  - Defines the main executable of the container.

					     - Unlike CMD, ENTRYPOINT is not easily overridden.

EXPOSE -  (-_-)  I hope no need for explanation.
		- Documents which port the app listens on.
